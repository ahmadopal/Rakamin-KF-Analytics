## 🏢 About Kimia Farma

**Kimia Farma** is the first pharmaceutical industry company in Indonesia, established by the Dutch East Indies Government in 1817. The name of the company was originally **NV Chemicalien Handle Rathkamp & Co**. Based on the nationalization policy of former Dutch companies in the early days of independence, in 1958, the Government of the Republic of Indonesia consolidated a number of pharmaceutical companies into PNF (State Pharmaceutical Company) **Bhinneka Kimia Farma**. Then on August 16, 1971, the legal form of PNF was changed to a Limited Liability Company, so the company name changed to **PT Kimia Farma (Persero)**.
